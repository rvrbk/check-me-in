# Functionalities
Users can make qr code and print them out or display them full screen. When participants check in the following things get registered
- time of check in
- user
- location

When making a qr code you can optionally check if you know what people will come, if you check this you can provide their names and email addresses. If there arent users for a project participants can enter their name upon scanning the qr code, if there are they can choose from a list 

# Layout
There are three buttons, home, new qr code and profile. The buttons are located at the bottom of the screen in mobile ([icon home | icon add | icon profile])
